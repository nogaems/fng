We're low on capable fighters to deal with the last remnants of our enemies, but we must rid our lands of all enemies.

It's true, the enemy is on the run, but we'd be fools to let them run and regroup. Hero, I need you to do the dirty work. Seek them out and get rid of those","Things have been too quiet lately, far too quiet. Our scouts report many small armies have set up camp on the borders of our lands, war is surely upon us. We need you to disrupt their activities, slow them down while we gather more forces. Do anything you can to halt those","There was once a noble order of druids who lived in the nearby forest. They still live there, but they are no longer noble, far from it. Their rituals seem more demonic than anything else and we cannot let them go on.

Hero, please go out there and destroy their traps, but be careful not to get caught in one yourself, it has happened to a few of us.","The other day I caught a huge fish. It was enormous! And by enormous I mean it was the biggest fish I've ever seen, it was probably the biggest fish anybody has ever and will ever see. Unfortunately, after I managed to catch it, the fish got away. It took my fishing rod with it and I really need it back. I'd go and get it myself, but it's underwater and I'm pretty sure that fish has a vendetta against me now. Would you mind getting it for me?","There is so much left to do, but so little time to do it in. I need to clean the stables, I need to sow the fields, feed my livestock, hunt for food and so much more. Please, could you help me with some of my tasks? I'm afraid my farm would collapse without your help.","There's a magnificent old creature which roams our lands. It's an elephant, older than almost all of us, but unfortunately its age is taking its toll. The predators are no longer afraid to attack it, more and more scars show up on its skin each day. Normally we'd let nature run its course, but this elephant is special, it means a lot to us. Hero, could you please try to lead the elephant towards our town, we have a build a sanctuary for it, so it can live out its final days in peace.","There's this girl I like and I mean really like. I want to impress her, but I don't know how. Do you have any ideas? I know she likes flowers, especially the ivory rose, but it's rare and I haven't managed to find a single one yet. They're supposed to grow in the swamp nearby, but I'm beginning to think they're just a myth. Could you give the marsh one last look? It would mean the world to me!","This old treasure map has been handed down from generation to generation and now it is mine. I decided to figure out where it leads to, but I'm a little lost now. The treasure should be around here, but I can't figure out the last part of this map. Mind helping me out with this?","We have a whole lot of work left to do in order to finish this castle, but many of our works have become lazy and they lack motivation. I need somebody to motivate them and I think you're the right person for the job. Go out there and give my workers a kick in the butt. Not literally of course, that would hurt them. Just make sure they remember what we're working on, that should ignite their inspiration again. If not, well, I guess a real kick in butt might be needed for some.","We need more coal for our forge or else we won't be able to supply the army with more weapons, but the mines have been overrun with weird creatures. Hero, please, venture into those mines and gather us coal, those creatures will be too scared to do anything to somebody as terrifying as you. Uh, no offense.","We need more firewood for the winter, but my foolish boyfriend managed to hurt his back while trying to fell too big of a tree. Would you mind gathering firewood for us, I'd do it myself, but now that my boyfriend can't work I have twice the work to do.","We're at war and war means we go through a whole lot of weaponry, ammunition and food. Obviously we can't reuse used food, but we can make use of used ammunition and weapons of the fallen. Hero, I need you to venture out into the fields to the West and gather the arrows and weapons laying around. It should be safe enough to do so now.","We're completely overwhelmed. The war is at its peak and more and more injured come into our hospital in search of aid, but we're running low in supplies. None of us can afford to leave the injured to seek out more supplies, so we need you to do so. Please gather Peaceblossom, sea urchin needles, silkweb and honey.","We've been struck by a dry spell, no rain has touched our lands for months and we're starting to feel its toll. Many of us are already too weak to do any real work and I'm afraid our first death will occur in a matter of days. Hero, please join me to the water pools, they're our last hope. If we bring 4 donkeys who should be able to carry plenty of water to at least save us for a while.","Winter is coming and I fear my food supplies might be too low. I got injured during a hunting trip and I still haven't recovered. Please, would you go out and do some hunting for me? 10 boars should be enough to last me long enough along with the supplies I do have.","You look like a person who likes to fish, but I doubt you're better than me. Let's put that to the test. We each get 10 minutes to catch the biggest fish we can find, if you can defeat me I'll reward you, but that's a very big if. About as big as the fish I'm going to catch, hahaha."];
