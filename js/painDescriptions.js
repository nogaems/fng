One hand reached for the stability of a wall while the other clasped their chest in agony","A dull pulsing pain crept up their leg, increasing in intensity every second. Ten seconds passed, and then another ten. The pain would soon become unbearable","Suddenly the pain from their wound flared up with an intensity unlike ever before.

Tired, but unable to sleep and unable to stop it","Desperate for some form of relief they sought out every solution. Ignoring it, working through it, using it to fuel strength. But nothing seemed to work","They were sure it'd all be over soon enough. Pain would never last that long, right?
