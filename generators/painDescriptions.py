Where it came from, how badly it hurt and how badly they wanted it to stop'), Js('They tried as best they could to block out the pain, to find some form of meditative trance in order to cope with the agonizing sensations'), Js('They held their fingers against their temples and gently massaged them. One deep breath followed another, surely this pain could be ignored if they tried'), Js('They closed their eyes and relaxed their muscles. They took a deep breath, and then another.

Some telling them everything will be fine, others telling them it won't be"), Js('It took them a moment to gather their thoughts, or at least gather enough of them to think a little clearer'), Js('They gently rubbed their injury and, with eyes staring at their hands, tried to figure out a way to relief themselves of this pain'), Js('It took them a minute or two to gather their composure, but conflicting thoughts still plagued their mind'), Js("The pain shouldn't be more than a minor nuisance to them, but right now it was far more than that"), Js('They paused for a moment and contemplated every answer to this pain, weighing each option and trying to find the best one')]))

They had two options: fight or give up'), Js('They felt thirsty and tired and sweat stains were clearly visible now, but they were determined to keep going'), Js('It became harder and harder to swallow the pain, to ignore the sensations and the voices telling them to stop'), Js("Fortunately there were some calm moments, moments when the pain was easy to manage and even easy to ignore, but they didn't last"), Js("It was difficult to focus between the moments of pain and the voices telling them to stop what they're doing, but they pressed onward"), Js('Fighting through the pain was becoming increasingly difficult, but above all else it became increasingly annoying to have to deal with'), Js('It had seemed like the pain had been there forever and in a way they were getting used to it, but at the same time the fact it might stick a little while longer was terrifying'), Js('Soft moans and grunts escaped their mouth. Tired and frustrated they wanted it all to be over and done with'), Js('They squeezed their eyes shut tight and their face turned to a grimace.

It wasn't ideal, but by the time they're done the pain will hopefully have subsided again"), Js('But unwilling to keep fighting they hopped in bed and were ready to sleep, a good rest would surely get rid of the pain.

Perhaps not the best solution, but they had made up their mind'), Js('But it was all too much for today. It was clear nothing could be done and nothing would get done. They might as well spend the rest of the day relaxing the best they can'), Js("On any other day they probably would've gone to bed and rested to make sure they'd heal well and fast, but not today. Today was a day of pushing the limits"), Js('But they felt sore all over, the injury was clearly taking its toll on their entire body. But they refused to let this day go to waste, so they pressed onward'), Js("However, there wasn't much they could do. Sure, painkillers would help a little, but they didn't like taking them. Instead they merely went on with their day the best they could, trying to swallow the pain whenever needed"), Js('But sick of having to deal with all this they decided to simply refuse to acknowledge the pain and get on with their day to the best of their ability'), Js("However, they felt like there wasn't much that could be done either way, so the best course of action was to simply deal with it and get on with life until the pain subsided"), Js('But they desperately kept themselves busy with mindless tasks and chores, but nothing really helped to ignore the pain. Eventually they gave in and headed to bed, tomorrow would surely be a better day'), Js('But it was clear to them that this was going to be a long day, but they were absolutely determined to not let this pain make this day an unfruitful one, so they pressed onward'), Js('For now the pain was manageable. Annoying, but manageable. They swallowed the pain and continued onward with their day, longing for the night and the bed that waited for them'), Js("They longed for their bed, a hot bath or just a fluffy pillow to lie on, but right now that wasn't an option to them. Right now all they cared about was carrying on and ignoring the pain")]))
